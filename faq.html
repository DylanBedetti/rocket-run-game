                        ascends into the sky, with the multiplier increasing the higher it goes. The goal is simple:
                        cash out before the rocket crashes. The catch? The timing of the crash is unpredictable, making
                        each round a thrilling experience.</dd>

                        Every outcome of <b>Rocket Run</b> is randomly generated. Low multipliers are likely, larger
                        multipliers are less likely.

                        </br></br>

                        You have a <code>50%</code> chance of the multiplier being between 1 and 2. You also have a
                        <code>50%</code> chance that
                        the multiplier is above 2.

                        If you really want to dig into the maths of it, the multiplier in <b>Rocket Run</b> is
                        determined by this
                        formula:</br></br>

                        <code class="block bg-gray-600 p-2 rounded">1 / Uniform(0,1)</code>

                        </br>

                        What sets <b>Rocket Run</b> apart from
                        other similar casino games is the absence of house odds. This means the game does not favor the
                        "house" in any way, offering a fair and transparent gaming experience for everyone. Each player
                        has an equal opportunity to win, making every game round a genuine test of nerve and timing.

                        Every round in <b>Rocket Run</b> is governed by a <b>Random Number Generator (RNG)</b>. This
                        ensures that the outcome of each game is entirely random and fair. The RNG system is designed to
                        guarantee that neither the players nor the game developers can predict
                        when the rocket will crash.

                        <b>Rocket Run</b> is a game without any house
                        edge and driven purely by randomness. This may give you a surge of confidence.
                        </br></br>
                        Casinos are fundamentally designed with a house edge. The house edge is a mathematical advantage
                        that the casino has over you in virtually every game they offer. It ensures that over time, the
                        casino doesn't just have a good chance of taking your money; it's almost a certainty.
                        </br></br>
                        Casinos, unlike <b>Rocket Run</b>, are not a level playing field. They're businesses built on
                        the
                        statistical certainty that players will lose more money than they win.
                        </br></br>
                        Casinos are engineered to be addictive. Beyond the financial ruin they can cause, casinos also
                        have a profound impact on mental health, contributing to stress, anxiety, and even severe
                        gambling addiction.
                        </br></br>
                        Enjoy <b>Rocket Run</b>, but when it comes to real-money gambling, approach with caution and
                        awareness of the real stakes involved.
